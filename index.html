      // -------------------
      // FULL SURAH 101–114
      // -------------------

      `**Surah Al-Qari’ah (101)**
The Striking Calamity –
What is the Striking Calamity?
And what can make you know what is the Striking Calamity?
The Day when people will be like scattered moths,
And the mountains will be like wool fluffed up.
Then as for one whose scales are heavy [with good deeds],
He will be in a pleasant life.
But as for one whose scales are light,
His refuge will be an abyss.`,

      `**Surah At-Takathur (102)**
Competition in worldly increase diverts you.
Until you visit the graves.
No! You will surely know.
Then no! You will surely know.
No! If you only knew with certainty…
You will surely see the Hellfire.
Then you will surely see it with the eye of certainty.`,

      `**Surah Al-Asr (103)**
By time,
Indeed, mankind is in loss,
Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds and advise each other to truth and advise each other to patience.`,

      `**Surah Al-Humazah (104)**
Woe to every scorner and mocker
Who collects wealth and counts it.
He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal.
No! He will surely be thrown into the Crusher.
And what can make you know what is the Crusher?
It is the Fire of Allah, fueled,
Which rises over the hearts.
Indeed, Hellfire will be closed upon them
In extended columns.`,

      `**Surah Al-Fil (105)**
Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant?
Did He not make their plan into misguidance?
And He sent against them birds in flocks,
Striking them with stones of hard clay,
And made them like eaten straw.`,

      `**Surah Quraysh (106)**
For the accustomed security of Quraysh,
Their accustomed security during the caravan of winter and summer,
Let them worship the Lord of this House,
Who fed them from hunger and secured them from fear.`,

      `**Surah Al-Ma'un (107)**
Have you seen the one who denies the Recompense?
For that is the one who drives away the orphan
And does not encourage the feeding of the poor.
So woe to those who pray
But are heedless of their prayer—
Those who show off
And withhold small kindnesses.`,

      `**Surah Al-Kawthar (108)**
Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar.
So pray to your Lord and sacrifice.
Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off.`,

      `**Surah Al-Kafirun (109)**
Say, "O disbelievers,
I do not worship what you worship,
Nor are you worshippers of what I worship.
Nor will I worship what you worship.
Nor will you be worshippers of what I worship.
For you is your religion, and for me is mine."`,

      `**Surah An-Nasr (110)**
When the victory of Allah has come and the conquest,
And you see the people entering Islam in multitudes,
Then praise your Lord and seek His forgiveness.
Indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance.`,

      `**Surah Al-Lahab (111)**
May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he.
His wealth will not benefit him.
He will enter a blazing Fire,
And his wife—the carrier of firewood.
Around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber.`,

      `**Surah Al-Ikhlas (112)**
Say, “He is Allah, One,
Allah, the Eternal Refuge.
He neither begets nor is born,
Nor is there to Him any equivalent.”`,

      `**Surah Al-Falaq (113)**
Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak,
From the evil of what He created,
From the evil of darkness when it settles,
From the evil of blowers of knots,
And from the evil of an envier when he envies.”`,

      `**Surah An-Nas (114)**
Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind,
The Sovereign of mankind,
The God of mankind,
From the evil of the whisperer,
Who whispers in the hearts of mankind,
Among jinn and mankind.”`,
