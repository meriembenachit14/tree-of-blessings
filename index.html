`Surah Al-Qari’ah (101)
The Striking Calamity –
What is the Striking Calamity?
And what can make you know what is the Striking Calamity?
The Day when people will be like scattered moths,
And the mountains will be like wool fluffed up.
Then as for one whose scales are heavy with good deeds,
He will be in a pleasant life.
But as for one whose scales are light,
His refuge will be an abyss.`,

`Surah At-Takathur (102)
Competition in worldly increase diverts you.
Until you visit the graves.
No! You will surely know.
Then no! You will surely know.
No! If you only knew with certainty…
You will surely see the Hellfire.
Then you will surely see it with the eye of certainty.`,

`Surah Al-Asr (103)
By time,
Indeed mankind is in loss,
Except for those who believe, do righteous deeds, and encourage truth and patience.`,

`Surah Al-Humazah (104)
Woe to every backbiter and slanderer
Who gathers wealth and counts it.
He thinks his wealth will make him immortal.
No! He will be thrown into the Crusher.
And what is the Crusher?
It is the Fire of Allah, eternally fueled,
Which rises over the hearts.
Indeed it will be closed in on them,
In extended columns.`,

`Surah Al-Fil (105)
Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant?
Did He not make their plan into misguidance?
And He sent against them birds in flocks,
Striking them with stones of hard clay,
And made them like eaten straw.`,

`Surah Quraysh (106)
For the accustomed security of Quraysh,
Their security in winter and summer journeys,
Let them worship the Lord of this House,
Who fed them from hunger and secured them from fear.`,

`Surah Al-Ma’un (107)
Have you seen the one who denies the Recompense?
That is the one who drives away the orphan,
And does not encourage feeding the poor.
So woe to those who pray,
But are heedless of their prayer,
Those who show off,
And withhold small kindnesses.`,

`Surah Al-Kawthar (108)
Indeed We have given you abundant goodness.
So pray to your Lord and sacrifice.
Indeed your enemy is the one cut off.`,

`Surah Al-Kafirun (109)
Say: O disbelievers,
I do not worship what you worship,
Nor are you worshippers of what I worship.
Nor will I worship what you worship,
Nor will you worship what I worship.
To you be your religion, and to me mine.`,

`Surah An-Nasr (110)
When the victory of Allah has come and the conquest,
And you see the people enter Allah’s religion in multitudes,
Then glorify your Lord with praise and seek His forgiveness.
Indeed, He is ever accepting of repentance.`,

`Surah Al-Lahab (111)
May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he.
His wealth will not help him.
He will burn in a blazing fire,
And his wife, the firewood carrier.
Around her neck is a rope of fiber.`,

`Surah Al-Ikhlas (112)
Say: He is Allah, One.
Allah, the Eternal Refuge.
He neither begets nor is born.
Nor is there anything comparable to Him.`,

`Surah Al-Falaq (113)
Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak,
From the evil of what He created,
From the evil of darkness when it settles,
From the evil of blowers in knots,
And from the evil of an envier when he envies.`,

`Surah An-Nas (114)
Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind,
The Sovereign of mankind,
The God of mankind,
From the evil of the whisperer who withdraws,
Who whispers in the hearts of mankind,
Of jinn and mankind.`,
