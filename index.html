/* ---------------- SURAH 101–114 ---------------- */

`Surah Al-Qari’ah (101)\n\nThe Striking Calamity –\nWhat is the Striking Calamity?\nAnd what can make you know what is the Striking Calamity?\nThe Day when people will be like scattered moths,\nAnd the mountains will be like wool fluffed up.\nThen as for one whose scales are heavy with good deeds,\nHe will be in a pleasant life.\nBut as for one whose scales are light,\nHis refuge will be an abyss.`,

`Surah At-Takathur (102)\n\nCompetition in worldly increase diverts you.\nUntil you visit the graves.\nNo! You will surely know.\nThen no! You will surely know.\nNo! If you only knew with certainty…\nYou will surely see the Hellfire.\nThen you will surely see it with the eye of certainty.`,

`Surah Al-Asr (103)\n\nBy time,\nIndeed mankind is in loss,\nExcept for those who believe, do righteous deeds, and encourage truth and patience.`,

`Surah Al-Humazah (104)\n\nWoe to every backbiter and slanderer\nWho gathers wealth and counts it.\nHe thinks his wealth will make him immortal.\nNo! He will be thrown into the Crusher.\nAnd what is the Crusher?\nIt is the Fire of Allah, eternally fueled,\nWhich rises over the hearts.\nIndeed it will be closed in on them,\nIn extended columns.`,

`Surah Al-Fil (105)\n\nHave you not considered how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant?\nDid He not make their plan into misguidance?\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks,\nStriking them with stones of hard clay,\nAnd made them like eaten straw.`,

`Surah Quraysh (106)\n\nFor the accustomed security of Quraysh,\nTheir security in winter and summer journeys,\nLet them worship the Lord of this House,\nWho fed them from hunger and secured them from fear.`,

`Surah Al-Ma’un (107)\n\nHave you seen the one who denies the Recompense?\nThat is the one who drives away the orphan,\nAnd does not encourage feeding the poor.\nSo woe to those who pray,\nBut are heedless of their prayer,\nThose who show off,\nAnd withhold small kindnesses.`,

`Surah Al-Kawthar (108)\n\nIndeed We have given you abundant goodness.\nSo pray to your Lord and sacrifice.\nIndeed your enemy is the one cut off.`,

`Surah Al-Kafirun (109)\n\nSay: O disbelievers,\nI do not worship what you worship,\nNor are you worshippers of what I worship.\nNor will I worship what you worship,\nNor will you worship what I worship.\nTo you be your religion, and to me mine.`,

`Surah An-Nasr (110)\n\nWhen the victory of Allah has come and the conquest,\nAnd you see the people enter Allah’s religion in multitudes,\nThen glorify your Lord with praise and seek His forgiveness.\nIndeed, He is ever accepting of repentance.`,

`Surah Al-Lahab (111)\n\nMay the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he.\nHis wealth will not help him.\nHe will burn in a blazing fire,\nAnd his wife, the firewood carrier.\nAround her neck is a rope of fiber.`,

`Surah Al-Ikhlas (112)\n\nSay: He is Allah, One.\nAllah, the Eternal Refuge.\nHe neither begets nor is born.\nNor is there anything comparable to Him.`,

`Surah Al-Falaq (113)\n\nSay: I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak,\nFrom the evil of what He created,\nFrom the evil of darkness when it settles,\nFrom the evil of blowers in knots,\nAnd from the evil of an envier when he envies.`,

`Surah An-Nas (114)\n\nSay: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind,\nThe Sovereign of mankind,\nThe God of mankind,\nFrom the evil of the whisperer who withdraws,\nWho whispers in the hearts of mankind,\nOf jinn and mankind.`,
