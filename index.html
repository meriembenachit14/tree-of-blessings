      "Al-Lahab (111): May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he. His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained. He will burn in a Fire of blazing flame, and his wife—the carrier of firewood...",
      "Al-Ikhlas (112): Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.'",
